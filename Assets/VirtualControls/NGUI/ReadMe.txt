You may redistribute the contents of this package as a part of your own Unity Package, even a
commercial one, provided that you clearly state that your package is using NGUI, and conditional
on you not altering the contents of the NGUI package other than removing the files you don't need.

The contents of this package may not be used in commercial products outside of those distributed
as Unity Packages.

Due to how this package was set up it is missing some of NGUI's editing tools, as well as all tutorials
and examples. In order to get them, simply download the Free version of NGUI by following this link:
http://www.tasharen.com/get.php?file=NGUI

Updating to NGUI Free / NGUI Standard:
- Create a new temporary scene (File -> New Scene)
- Delete the entire NGUI folder (first make sure your data is outside of it!)
- Import the updated unitypackage
